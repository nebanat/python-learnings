- Write tests 
- Run the tests (make sure tests fail)
- Write the actual code 
- Re-run the tests  - making sure all test pass
- Refactor and improve

### Pros

- Saves you debugging time in the long run
- Forces you to write code that is testable

### Cons
- Leads to blindspot especially if developer wrote the test
